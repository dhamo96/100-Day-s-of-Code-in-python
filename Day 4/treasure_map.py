# You are going to write a program that will mark a spot with an X.

# In the starting code, you will find a variable called map.

# This map contains a nested list. When map is printed this is what the nested list looks like:

# [['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️'],['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️'],['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']]

# This is a bit hard to work with. So on lines 6 and 23, we've used this line of code print(f"{row1}\n{row2}\n{row3}" to format the 3 lists to be printed as a 3 by 3 square, each on a new line. 

# ['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']

# ['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']

# ['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']

# Your job is to write a program that allows you to mark a square on the map using a two-digit system. 

# The first digit in the input will specify the column (the position on the horizontal axis).

# The second digit in the input will specify the row number (the position on the vertical axis). 

# So an input of 23 should place an X at the position shown below:

row1 = ["⬜️","️⬜️","️⬜️"]
row2 = ["⬜️","⬜️","️⬜️"]
row3 = ["⬜️️","⬜️️","⬜️️"]
map = [row1, row2, row3]
print(f"{row1}\n{row2}\n{row3}")
position = input("Where do you want to put the treasure? ")

col = int(position[0])
row = int(position[1])
# print(col)

selected_row = map[row - 1]
selected_row[col-1] = "X"
# print(selected_row)

print(f"{row1}\n{row2}\n{row3}")
